Welcome to my personal website!

I am a Postdoc at EPFL, in the laboratory of [Prof. Le Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec), and I am currently working on the deterministic performance analysis of [time-sensitive networking (TSN)](https://1.ieee802.org/tsn/) using the [network-calculus framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_calculus).

I am currently looking for new opportunities within the network-calculus/TSN research community. My research interests include the performance analysis of computer networks using measurements, simulations, and deterministic approaches.

A short summary of my education:

* I received the Master's degree in aerospace engineering from [ISAE-SUPAERO](https://www.isae-supaero.fr/fr/) in 2018. 
My master's thesis was supervised by [Prof. Emmanuel Lochin](https://elochin.github.io/) and [Dr. Nicolas Kuhn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-kuhn-65a026a5/). 
You can find my dissertation [here](/files/2018-11-master-thesis-dissertation.pdf) (in French).

* I received the PhD degree in Computer Science and Telecommunications from ISAE-SUPAERO in 2022.
My PhD was supervised by [Prof. Ahlem Mifdaoui](https://pagespro.isae-supaero.fr/ahlem-mifdaoui/) and [Prof. Jean-Yves Le Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec).
I performed half of my PhD as a visiting research assistant at EPFL.
You can find my dissertation [here](/files/2022-10-phd-dissertation.pdf) (in English) and the replay of my defense [here](/talk/2022-09-12-phd-defense).
