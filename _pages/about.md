Welcome to my personal website !

I'm a Postdoc at EPFL, in the laboratory of [Prof. Le Boudec](https://people.epfl.ch/jean-yves.leboudec)) and I am currently working on the deterministic performance analysis of time-sensitive networking (TSN) technologies using the network-calculus framework.
My research interests include the performance analysis of computer networks using measurements, simulations, and deterministic approaches.

I received the masterâ€™s in aerospace engineering from ISAE-SUPAERO in 2018 and the PhD degree in Computer Science and Telecommunications from ISAE-SUPAERO in 2022.

I'm currently looking for opportunities with research and teaching duties.
Don't hesitate to contact me!
