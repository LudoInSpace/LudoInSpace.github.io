Welcome to my personal website!

I am a CNRS Researcher (Charg√© de Recherche) at [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/en/) (Nancy, France) in the [SIMBIOT](https://simbiot.gitlabpages.inria.fr/web/index.html) team.
I am currently working on the deterministic performance analysis of [time-sensitive networking (TSN)](https://1.ieee802.org/tsn/) using the [network-calculus framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_calculus).
