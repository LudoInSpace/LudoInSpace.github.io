This article proposes a discussion on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats related to the deployment of QUIC end-to-end from a satellite-operator point-of-view. The deployment of QUIC is an opportunity for improving the quality of experience when exploiting satellite broadband accesses. Indeed, the fast establishment of secured connections reduces the short files transmission time. Moreover, removing transport layer performance enhancing proxies reduces the cost of network infrastructures and improves the integration of satellite systems. However, the congestion and flow controls at end points are not always suitable for satellite communications due to the intrinsic high bandwidth-delay product. Further acceptance of QUIC in satellite systems would be guaranteed if its performance in specific use-cases is increased. We propose a running code for an IETF document, and based on an emulated platform and on open-source software, this paper proposes values of performance metrics just as one piece of the puzzle. The final performance objective requires consensus among the different actors. The objective should be challenging enough for satellite operators to allow QUIC traffic but reasonable enough to keep QUIC deployable on the Internet.
